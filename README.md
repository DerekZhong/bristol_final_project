# bristol_final_project

Code is written in ipynb format. Strongly recommend open it in Google Colab or jupyter notebook.

This code is consisted of 3 parts.
1. Resnet50 training for skeleton model, inertial model and fused model.
2. ViT training for skeleton model, inertial model and fused model.
3. Adaptive weighting implementation in ViT (the saved_weights also uploaded)

model weights is saved in h5 format
